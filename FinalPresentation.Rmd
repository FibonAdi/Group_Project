# Model
- 1st model: Watch time (followers and stream time)
- 2nd model: Average Views (followers, watch time and stream time)

- Uneven distribution (clumped data) so difficult to extend
- Take log scale to minimize outlier effects and better visuals (see graphs)

---

# Limitations
- Type of Content the streamer makes.
- Whether the streamer follows trends or not.
- Whether the streamer is popular on other platforms already which may inflate their Twitch numbers.

---
# Overall Findings 
- Through our graphs we showed multiple correlations, some expected such as when watch time increases the number of followers does too or similarly as stream time increases the number of followers increases as well. However, we also have some findings we did not expect such as, the longer stream time is the more the number of viewers declines.
